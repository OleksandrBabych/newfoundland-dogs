        <p><em>The <b>Newfoundland dog</b> is a large working dog. They can be either black, brown, or white-and-black (called Landseer).<br>
        However, in Canada, the country of their origin, the only correct colours are either black or Landseer.<br>
        They were originally bred and used as a working dog for fishermen in the Dominion of Newfoundland<br>
        (which is now part of Canada).They are known for their giant size, intelligence, tremendous strength,<br>
        calm dispositions, and loyalty. <b>Newfoundland dogs</b> excel at water rescue/lifesaving because of their muscular build,<br>
        thick double coat, webbed feet, and innate swimming abilities.</em></p><hr>
